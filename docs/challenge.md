1. **Imported Libraries**:
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- `xgboost` for the XGBoost model.
- Various utilities from `scikit-learn` for data splitting, metrics, etc.
- `datetime` for date and time operations.

2. **Helper Functions**:
- `get_period_day(date)`: Determines the period of the day (morning, afternoon, or night) based on the given time.
- `is_high_season(fecha)`: Determines if the given date is in the high season.

3. **DelayPredictor Class**:
- **Constructor**: Initializes the model and possibly loads a pre-trained model if provided.
- `load_data(...)`: Loads data from a file, performs some preprocessing tasks like one-hot encoding, and returns features and optionally target.
- `fit(...)`: Trains the XGBoost model on the provided features and target.
- `predict(...)`: Predicts using the trained model and returns a list of predictions.
- `prepare_data_and_model(...)`: Prepares the training and test data and initializes the XGBoost model.

4. **Chosen Model**:
The XGBClassifier from the xgboost library is used for this task. XGBoost is a popular choice for classification tasks due to:
- Its ability to handle large datasets.
- Capability to deal with missing data.
- Feature importance which gives interpretability.

Reasons for choosing XGBoost:
- Efficient implementation of the gradient boosting framework.
- Provides better accuracy with fewer data preprocessing requirements.
- Handles missing values internally.
- Provides feature importance which can be useful for feature engineering.
